Custom Chrome OS Launchers
===============

Just a few of my own Chrome OS Launchers

To Install:
1. Download the folder (and all the files in it)
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ (make sure "Developer Mode" is checked off)
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
4. Find the launcher folder
5. Click "Open" (do not double click)
6. It should show up in your App launcher
